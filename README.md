# ECL_WEB-Initial- is an online platform designed to assist users in finding the latest prices and information on various computer parts. 
Whether you're looking for a new graphics card, processor, RAM, or storage drive, this web app provides a centralized catalog with updated pricing from different vendo.
Users can browse through parts, compare options, and make more informed decisions before purchasing. The platform also includes a "Vendo Box" section,
which showcases pre-assembled or pre-packaged component sets, complete with their specifications and current pricing — 
a great feature for those looking to buy entire builds or kits without individually picking each component.

However, some concerns may arise during the development and use of the platform. Ensuring price accuracy across multiple vendors can be challenging, 
especially if the data is not automated or regularly updated. There are also security concerns, particularly if the site will allow user accounts,
payment integration, or vendor submissions — all of which must be protected from potential misuse or attacks. Another issue is scalability: 
as the number of components and vendors grows, maintaining speed and reliability for users becomes critical. 
Addressing these concerns early on will help build a more robust and trustworthy web service.
