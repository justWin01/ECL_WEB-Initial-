Integrated Service Request, Inventory, and Client Payment Transaction System
for ECL-Micro Network and Data Solutions

This repository presents a web-based integrated system developed for ECL-Micro Network and Data Solutions. The system automates the management of service requests, inventory, and client payment transactions, replacing traditional manual processes with an efficient computerized solution.

This project represents a possible system output for ECL-Micro Network and Data Solutions, designed to support daily operations, improve data accuracy, and enhance decision-making.

Project Objectives
General Objective

To develop an integrated web-based system that automates and manages service requests, inventory, and client payment transactions for ECL-Micro Network and Data Solutions, improving operational efficiency and record management.

Specific Objectives

To design and implement a service request module that enables clients to submit service reports and allows staff and administrators to process and monitor requests efficiently.

To develop an inventory tracking and management system that ensures accurate monitoring of products, parts, and stock levels.

To generate comprehensive reports on service requests, inventory status, and client payment transactions to support management decision-making.

System Scope

This system focuses on the development of an Integrated Service Request, Inventory, and Client Payment Transaction System tailored specifically for ECL-Micro Network and Data Solutions.

The system supports the following core functions:

Submission and management of client service requests

Inventory recording, tracking, and updating of stock levels

Recording and monitoring of client payment transactions

Role-based access for Admin, Staff, and Clients

Generation of basic operational reports

The primary goal is to replace manual processes with a centralized digital platform that reduces errors, organizes records, and improves overall operational efficiency.

System Limitations

Despite its functionality, the system has the following limitations:

The system is designed exclusively for internal use within ECL-Micro Network and Data Solutions and is not connected to other branches or external systems.

Advanced features such as mobile application support, third-party integrations, and automated analytics are not included.

System evaluation focuses only on its basic functionalities, namely:

Service request management

Inventory tracking

Client payment transaction recording

Large-scale deployment, performance stress testing, and enterprise-level scalability are outside the scope of this project.

Target Users

Admin – Manages inventory, staff assignments, payments, and reports

Staff/Technicians – Handles assigned service requests and updates task status

Clients – Submits service requests, checks status, and makes payments
